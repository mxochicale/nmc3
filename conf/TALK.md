Dear Miguel,

My name is Marco Simões and I will be hosting the neuromatch session of your presentation, along with Kami (cc).  You have already received the email from Neuromatch with the session details, zoom link, etc. The email also includes instructions on what to do in case you are unable to get into the zoom session. Please note that all speakers should log on and enter the session 10 mins before the session start time. 

Please keep our emails in case you need to contact us before your talk tomorrow (28th) at 5 pm eastern time (UTC time). Please remember to keep your talk duration at 12 minutes plus 3 minutes for questions. 

As your MC, I will introduce you, let you know how much time remains as you speak, and ask questions for the audience.

In order for me to introduce you, can you provide me with some details? See below some examples of information I
find useful to share:

Position:
Twitter (if you have one):
Would you like your Twitter posted to the session chat?:
Link to a recent article you'd like featured in chat:
Any other things you'd like mentioned:

Please note that we have to wrap up the session right at 5:45, so the time limits will be strictly enforced so that each speaker gets 15 minutes to talk & answer questions. At :50,
the room will boot us all out, so we don't have any wiggle room with the time durations.
Thanks again, and have a good day today! 

Best,
Marco
