# Title
Nonlinear analysis to quantify 
human movement variability from time-series data 

# Abstract
Human movement complexity arises from the process of mastering 
redundant (bio)mechanical degrees of freedom
(DOF) to successfully accomplish any given motor task (Bernstein, 1967).
Such DOF are (in)dependent coordinates to uniquely
describe a joint configuration of he motor system which provides 
flexibility and stability to adapt to a changing environment conditions.
Consequently, human movement variability is always present in even 
the simplest movements. 
That said, this talk will touch on three points:
(a) theoretical models for human movement variability and methods to quantify human movement variability, 
(b) how nonlinear methods can help to measure real-world time series data (e.g. non-stationary, non-linearity, data length size, sensor sources or noise), and 
(c) illustration of results for real-world time-series data from human-robot imitation activities.
I will then add few of the current and future challenges on this subject 
and how the above points might lead to development tools to evaluate, 
for instance, the improvement of movement performances, 
to quantify and provide feedback of skill learning or 
to quantify movement adaptations and pathologies.

## Blurs
### Blurs for title:
* Instead of averaging all away, celebrating diversity:

### Blurs for abstract
* and with the hope to get some interests discussions that might lead to collaborations, 

* How to quantify the dynamics of brain signals can be tackle 
in different way, and most of the studies 

* Studies for variability spacial and temporal variability in the general 
would consider individual background 

* Multidimentional time-series data analysys such as electroencephalogram (EEG),
inertial sensors.
