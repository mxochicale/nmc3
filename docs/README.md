# Neuromatch 3.0
Site: https://neuromatch.io/  

## GUIDELINES
Traditional Talks will be scheduled for a single 15 minutes time slot , consisting of a 12 minutes presentation and 3 minutes of Q&A. Speakers are expected to show up 5 minutes before their session starts and attend the full session to allow for great discussions.

All abstracts are limited to 300 words and topical keywords will be chosen upon submission. Each submission will be accompanied by indicating the time slots where one is available to attend the conference (for presentation or viewing). Each abstract submitter must also participate in the abstract feedback process after the submission window where one indicates which abstracts one is are most interested in attending (aided by our matching algorithms). Abstracts will be viewed without author names or institutions to increase fairness and reduce prestige bias. This information will be used to aid in determining the conference schedule. Abstracts will be withdrawn and not presented if the submitter does not participate in the feedback period.
